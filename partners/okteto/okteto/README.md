# Okteto

Okteto is a development platform for Kubernetes applications. Build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in your own Kubernetes infrastructure. Give your team the power of the [Okteto Development Platform](https://okteto.com/docs), with the control and flexibility of running in your Kubernetes infrastructure.

With Okteto you and your team can:

- Deploy your development environments with the [Okteto CLI](https://www.okteto.com/docs/get-started/install-okteto-cli/) or from your [Git Repositories](https://www.okteto.com/docs/development/deploy/deploy-from-git/)
- Configure [Variables](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/okteto-variables/) and prevent secure credentials from being stored in version control
- Expose your development environments via [Automatic HTTPs Endpoints](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/endpoints/automatic-ssl/) for your services or [Private Endpoints](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/endpoints/private-endpoints/) to restrict access
- Build your images directly in the cloud using the [Okteto Build Service](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/build-service/)
- Push your container images in the [Okteto Registry](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/container-registry/)
- Create secure [Kubernetes Namespaces](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/namespaces/) with one click
- Download your [Kubernetes Credentials](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/credentials/kubernetes-credentials/) to access your namespaces with kubectl, helm, or any other CLI tool
- Collaborate by [sharing](https://www.okteto.com/docs/core/namespaces/#share-your-namespace) your namespaces with your teammates
- Keep your infrastructure under control with the [Okteto Garbage Collector](https://www.okteto.com/docs/admin/cleanup/).
