# OKTETO_VERSION is the current okteto chart version.
# In most of the cases, this value should match the version in Chart.yaml. The
# exception to this is if an umbrella chart is used from which .Chart.Version is
# computed. For this reason .Chart.Version cannot be trusted and this version
# should always be used instead.
# This is the version displayed in the admin panel and the version reported in
# telemetry
# This value is updated in the release process and packaged alongside the chart
# There is no need to touch this value unless you know what you are doing
OKTETO_VERSION: 1.31.0
